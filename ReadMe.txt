This is a mod that is blowing away all the EncounterList arrays from the relevant mods. Just to be safe, I am getting rid of them, whether I am actually going to be editing them or not (but in most cases I am).

Finally, there will be a vanilla folder so I can blow away the configs for any unaffected vanilla units that I am changing (which shouldn't be many, if any)

For now, this is a separate mod that should get loaded before anything else (thus the 000 at the start of the name). I MAY end up merging this with my overall 2022 config change mod, but I'm not sure about that yet.
